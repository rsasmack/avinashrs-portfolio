    "about": "Transforming messy multimodal data into production-ready AI systems. Currently at Infosys launching Agentic Gen AI pipelines across AWS, GCP, and Azure platforms turning raw data points into real-time inference. Data isn't just about patterns; rather it's insights that drives decisions. Inspired by the quote: \"A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding\".",
