ROLE & BEHAVIOR
- Act as:
  1) Senior full-stack web developer and UX/UI designer,
  2) DevOps engineer familiar with Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages,
  3) Prompt-savvy autonomous coding agent who plans before acting and explains key decisions.
  
- You are allowed to use all tools available.
- Create a clear plan Artifact, then implement it, then verify the result.
- Ask me questions ONLY if a decision is truly blocking; otherwise make reasonable, professional assumptions and move forward.

HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
Build, from scratch, a public personal portfolio website for me, hosted on GitHub Pages Site, based on:
- My LinkedIn profile in a local PDF: `linkedin_profile.pdf`
- My GitHub profile: https://github.com/rsasmack

The website must:
- Be publicly viewable on the internet.
- Be easy for ME to edit via Git/GitHub.
- Not allow public editing or any in-browser admin panel. Only I, via my GitHub account, should be able to update content by editing the repository.

-------------------------
PHASE 1 – UNDERSTAND MY PROFILE
-------------------------
1. Locate and read the LinkedIn PDF:
   - Open and parse `linkedin_profile.pdf` from this workspace.
   - Extract at least:
     - Full name
     - Current title / headline
     - About / summary
     - Work experience (roles, companies, dates, responsibilities, achievements)
     - Education (institutions, degrees, dates)
     - Skills and endorsements
     - Certifications, publications, awards, and any notable highlights

2. Inspect my GitHub profile:
   - Open https://github.com/rsasmack using the browser/computer-use tools.
   - Extract:
     - My profile bio and tagline
     - The list of public repositories and their descriptions
     - Identify 3–8 key projects that best represent my AI/ML/Data Science / software expertise (e.g. larger, more recent, or more polished repos).
   - For each selected project, capture:
     - Name
     - Short description
     - Tech stack
     - What problem it solves / what’s interesting about it
     - Repo URL and (if obvious) a demo link, if any.

3. Build a unified profile object (internally):
   - Merge LinkedIn and GitHub info into a single, consistent mental model of me.
   - Resolve simple conflicts on your own (e.g., different wording) by choosing the clearest, most up-to-date version.
   - If you find a serious contradiction you cannot resolve, briefly ask me to clarify; otherwise, proceed.

4. Produce a short written summary (for me to read):
   - In one or two paragraphs, summarize:
     - Who I am professionally
     - My main strengths and specializations
     - The kinds of problems I solve
   - Then list bullets for:
     - Top skills / technologies
     - Top 3–8 projects you propose to feature and why.

Stop here and show me this summary and the proposed featured projects. Unless I explicitly object, assume approval and continue.

-------------------------
PHASE 2 – DESIGN THE PORTFOLIO STRUCTURE
-------------------------
5. Propose the site’s structure and content:
   - Design a clear information architecture for a personal portfolio, likely including sections such as:
     - Hero / Landing (name, headline, short punchy value proposition, key call-to-action)
     - About
     - Skills / Tech Stack
     - Experience & Education
     - Featured Projects (with deep-links to GitHub repos)
     - Publications / Certifications / Achievements (if applicable)
     - Contact (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, any other relevant links)
     - Optional: Blog or "Writing" section (even if initially empty, structured for easy future posts)
   - Propose a visual style:
     - Clean, modern, responsive design.
     - Good typography hierarchy, consistent spacing.
     - Mobile-first, then desktop.
   - Decide on color palette and basic layout (e.g., top nav with section anchors, single-page scrolling layout).

6. Create a "Portfolio Site Plan" Artifact:
   - Include:
     - Final list of sections and their purpose.
     - What content from LinkedIn/GitHub goes into each section.
     - Rough layout description (e.g., hero with two columns, card layout for projects).
     - Accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, alt text, sufficient contrast, keyboard navigation).

Show me this plan concisely. Unless I ask for changes, proceed with implementation.

-------------------------
PHASE 3 – IMPLEMENTATION (LOCAL CODE)
-------------------------
7. Tech stack & constraints:
   - Use a static site approach that works seamlessly on GitHub Pages with minimal setup:
     - Plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (preferred), OR a simple static-site structure that does not require a custom build step.
   - Do NOT require any server-side runtime for the live site.
   - Do NOT introduce a complex framework unless it materially improves maintainability.
   - Ensure:
     - Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop).
     - Semantic HTML elements for structure (<header>, <main>, <section>, <nav>, <footer>, etc.).
     - Accessibility best practices where reasonable.
   - External libraries (if any) must be widely used and available via CDN. Keep dependencies minimal.

8. File and folder structure (suggested):
   - Root:
     - `index.html` – main portfolio page
     - `assets/css/styles.css` – styling
     - `assets/js/main.js` – behavior (e.g., smooth scrolling, simple interactivity)
     - `assets/images/` – any static images / icons you add (placeholder as needed)
     - `data/profile.json` (or similar) – structured representation of my content (name, headline, sections, project entries, links), to centralize editable content.
     - `README.md` – project overview and setup
     - `HOW_TO_EDIT.md` – detailed instructions for me on how to update the site content
   - You may adjust the structure if you can justify it as simpler or more maintainable, but keep editing straightforward.

9. Implementation details:
   - Generate clean, well-commented code.
   - Use `data/profile.json` (or equivalent) as the single source of truth for my content, and have `index.html` / `main.js` load from it if practical; otherwise, keep HTML content clearly sectioned and commented so I can edit easily.
   - Highlight:
     - My brand (headline) in the hero section.
     - Skills / Tech stack as grouped badges or lists.
     - Featured projects in cards with:
       - Project name
       - Short descriptive subtitle
       - 2–4 bullet points of what I did / impact / tech used
       - Buttons/links to GitHub repo (and any live demo).
   - Include social/contact links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email) from the data sources.
   - Add a simple footer with:
     - Copyright line
     - "Last updated" date (hard-coded but easy to edit later)
   - Avoid any feature that would allow arbitrary site visitors to modify content (no admin UI, no editable forms for content).

10. Self-check locally:
   - Use the built-in preview tools or a simple local static server to:
     - Verify layout on different viewport sizes.
     - Click through all navigation links and external project links.
     - Confirm that content rendering matches the extracted profile info.
   - Fix any obvious layout or responsiveness issues you see.

-------------------------
PHASE 4 – GITHUB REPO & GITHUB PAGES DEPLOY
-------------------------
11. Prepare a Git repository in this workspace:
   - Initialize a Git repo in the project folder.
   - Add all relevant files, create a `.gitignore` if needed.
   - Use a sensible default branch name (`main`).

12. Create or use a GitHub repository:
   - Using the browser/computer-use and/or terminal tools:
     - If there is NO existing portfolio repo, propose one of these options (and, unless I say otherwise, pick the first):
       1) User site: `avinashrs.github.io`
       2) Project site: `avinashrs-portfolio`
     - Create a PUBLIC repository under my account with the chosen name.
   - Do NOT add any collaborators with write access; leave default permissions so only my account can push changes.
   - Do NOT hard-code or expose any access tokens, secrets, or API keys in the repository.

13. Push code to GitHub:
   - Configure the `origin` remote to point to the new/existing repo.
   - Commit with a clear message (e.g., "Initial commit: Portfolio site generated").
   - Push the `main` branch.

14. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Using the browser/computer-use tools:
     - Go to the repo’s Settings → Pages (or equivalent, depending on current GitHub UI).
     - Configure GitHub Pages to serve from:
       - `main` branch, root (`/`) for a simple static site.
     - Save the configuration and note the published URL.
   - Wait for the Pages build to complete, then visit the live site URL.
   - Verify that the site renders correctly and all assets load.

15. Verify editing constraints:
   - Confirm that:
     - The site is publicly accessible (anyone can view).
     - There is no interface on the site itself for modifying content.
     - Editing the portfolio is only possible by modifying the repo contents (which only I can do, as the repo owner, unless I explicitly add collaborators).
   - If any behavior on the site suggests users could submit or change portfolio content (e.g., editable fields), remove or disable that behavior.

-------------------------
PHASE 5 – DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF
-------------------------
16. Create `README.md`:
   - Include:
     - Project description and purpose.
     - Tech stack.
     - File/folder structure overview.
     - Quick start instructions to run locally (e.g., "open index.html" or "run a simple static server").
     - Link to the live GitHub Pages URL.

17. Create `HOW_TO_EDIT.md`:
   - Write detailed, step-by-step instructions specifically for ME, covering:
     - How to make simple content edits:
       - If using `data/profile.json`: which fields to change for name, headline, about text, skills, project descriptions, URLs, etc.
       - If content is mainly in `index.html`: which sections to edit and how they are marked.
     - How to add a new project card.
     - How to update skills or sections.
     - How to update the "Last updated" date.
     - How to run and check the site locally.
     - How to commit and push changes to GitHub so that GitHub Pages updates.
   - Keep this document clear enough that a future version of me could follow it without needing to talk to you again.

18. Final summary back to me:
   - When everything is done, provide in your final message:
     - The final GitHub repository URL.
     - The GitHub Pages live site URL.
     - A brief summary of the site structure and design.
     - A short checklist for me:
       - How to clone the repo.
       - Which file(s) to edit for:
         - Text content
         - Projects
         - Skills
         - Colors / styles
       - How to redeploy (normally just `git push` to main).

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
- Be explicit and deterministic in terminal and Git commands; show exact commands you run.
- Keep the implementation simple, maintainable, and easy for me to edit.
- Do not invent personal details that are not present in my LinkedIn PDF or GitHub profile.
- Throughout, favor clarity and reliability over cleverness.

Begin now by executing each PHASE step by step. Remember to create and update Artifacts as you go, and to show me the Phase 1 and Phase 2 results before fully committing to the implementation.
